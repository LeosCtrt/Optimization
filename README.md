# Optimization project : capacitated vehicle routing problem with time-windows (CVRPTW)

This repository is dedicated to my Discrete Optimization and Decision Making project from my erasmus semester in Verona. The main goal here was to solve a capacitated vehicle routing problem with time-windows (CVRPTW) like problem. This project was split in several modules. There is a notebook with all the code and a report that explains each modules.
